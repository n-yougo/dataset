Baer C1, Nees M, Breit S, Selle B, Kulozik AE, Schaefer KL, Braun Y, Wai D, Poremba C.

Diagnostic classes:
- Ewing's sarcoma (EWS): 11 examples (47.8%)
- Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS): 12 examples (52.2%)
Number of genes: 9945
Number of samples: 23
Note: From the originally measured 12625 probe sets we removed genes that were not present (P) in at least one sample
